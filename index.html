      <p>Hello, I am Steve Finn. I am currently a sophomore Computer Science and Software Engineering student at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.
        I was first introduced to computer science and coding as a sophomore in High School during a Principles of Engineering class. Since then,
        I have extremely enjoyed learning more coding skills and the many opportunities that are available to accomplish with computer science. I am a part
        of Residence Life here at Rose-Hulman as a Sophomore Advisor. This position allows me to meet and mentor new freshmen and become their friend as 
        they work through their freshman year.
      </p>

      <p>Outside of school, my main hobbies include golf, reading, and hanging out with friends. I have been playing golf since I was in seventh grade,
        although I haven't been able to as much since starting college. I also really enjoy watching basically any sport, especially the Colts and PGA Tour.
        I am also a member of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity here at Rose. Through Pike, I have been able to meet many awesome people who have helped me with
        advice or just cheering me up whenever I am struggling with something.
      </p>
